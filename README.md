# SteamAPI
Packages for using Valve's official and unofficial Steam Web APIs.

This project is still in an early stage, and probably won't work for you.

The official API uses URLs like http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamWebAPIUtil/GetSupportedAPIList/v1/
and is documented  at https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi_overview and https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API.

The unofficial API uses URLs like http://store.steampowered.com/api/appdetails/?appids=32330
and is ‘documented’ at wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/User:RJackson/StorefrontAPI.
